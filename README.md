# sfdc_configcomparer
Configuration comparison tool


Initial commits of a new tool.  More to follow, but,

- Running a major program of work with 5 streams of SFDC work and we need a neat little tool to show non-technical team members the differences between environments.

Focus will be the profile object to start with as that is the hardest to read using a comparison tool.

Many features will probably be needed :)
